# Stroke Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for analyzing stroke-related data using Python and Pandas. The notebook fetches data from Google Drive and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

## Features
- Reads and processes stroke-related data from a CSV file stored in Google Drive.
- Utilizes Pandas for data manipulation and transformation.
- Displays data summaries and statistics.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install pandas
  ```

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`stroke.ipynb`) in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.
2. Ensure the dataset is accessible from Google Drive.
3. Run the notebook cells to load, process, and analyze the data.
